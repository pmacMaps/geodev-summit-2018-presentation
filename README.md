Presentation and coding demo from  _Integrating ArcGIS Services with Leaflet.js_ session at the 2018 GeoDev Summit.

At the 2018 [GeoDev Summit](http://summits.harrisburgu.edu/geodev/), I gave a talk on how to integrate Esri services with the Leaflet.js web mapping library.  This repository contains the introductory **presentation** and **sample code** from the demonstration.  

The following topics were covered:

* Adding basemaps from ArcGIS Online
* Adding feature layers and creating pop-ups
* Adding a map control to switch between basemaps
* Creating a geosearch control, and searching against a geocoding service or within a feature layer
* Performing attribute and spatial queries against a service
